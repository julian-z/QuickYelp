# Purpose üöÄ
QuickYelp is a dynamic AI chatbot which scans through the reviews of a given Yelp business, then answers questions based on its training data. With this program, users are able to save a ton of time from having to manually read through the reviews themselves. Thus, our goal is to offer an easy and efficient way to retrieve a quick overview of a restaurant, as well as answer questions to the best of its ability.

# How It Works üß†
QuickYelp is powered by three APIs:

1. Yelp Fusion API
2. OpenAI API
3. LangChain

The purpose of Yelp Fusion is to retrieve data related to the business in question. As for LangChain and OpenAI, these technologies are used to train the chatbot, running off OpenAI's ChatGPT.
